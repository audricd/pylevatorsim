# pylevatorsim
python training program, elevator simulator, not meant for any use besides keeping track of my own learning

2/5/2019:
v0.1: cleaned up draft, basic function working: calculates the difference between current_floor and target_floor, and difference
is returned with "elevator going up or down" depending on the result
